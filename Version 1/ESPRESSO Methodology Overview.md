# Introduction
The ESPRESSO project is composed of two elements:
1. A dataset showing estimated taxes collected within local authority areas; and expenditure by public sector organisations across local authority areas.
2. An Excel-based tool that allows users to analyse and explore the data in more detail.

The project uses a multitude of data sources and calculation methodologies to split national, regional or local data out to local authority geographies. Our work aims to identify and match these data sources as accurately as possible.

This document outlines the methodologies used to ascertain the relevant data, and the original sources of the data.

The data is available in this repo under 'Version 1'. The tax data is provided as a csv file, while the expenditure data is too large to maintain as a single csv. It is therefore split into part 1 and part 2. A union can be created between the two.

# Contents
There are four parts to this methodology:
## 1. General principles
This section shows the principles behind the calculations and methodology used in version 1 of the ESPRESSO data. These principles set out how we split out or amalgamated data to identify tax and expenditure data at a local authority level.

## 2. Tax data
This section explains the sources of tax data, and the methods of disaggregation and assignment to local authority areas.

## 3. Expenditure data
This section explains the sources of public sector expenditure data, and the methods of disaggregation and assignment to local authority areas.

## 4. Future developments
This section explores potential future developments of version 1 of the ESPRESSO project over time.

There are also four appendices to supplement the information:
 - Appendix A: Calculations for tax data
 - Appendix B: Calculations for expenditure data
 - Appendix C: List of local authority districts
 - Appendix D: Local authority district lookups
