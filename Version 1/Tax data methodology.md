# Tax data

Tax data come from a variety of sources. There are multiple options to source total expenditure, however the main source has been the national disaggregations of tax receipts provided directly by HMRC.

Where data are not already provided at a local level, a disaggregation methodology has been applied. The main disaggregation method is by population, from the annual Mid-Year Population Estimates produced by ONS. However, in many cases a weighted proportion is identified - for example, to calculate Vehicle Excise Duty, the total number of registered vehicles is multiplied by the average national licence value for each body type in each area, and this is used to apportion out the total national VED receipts.

Some of the calculations are relatively complex, as the apportionment methodology uses a series of weighted values. For example, the income tax figure is split by the estimated income tax paid on the average salary for each area, multiplied by the number in employment in the area.

The table in Appendix A shows how the disaggregations of tax data have been made to the local authority level, including explanatory notes and data sources.
