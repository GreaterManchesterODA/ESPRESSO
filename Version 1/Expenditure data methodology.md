# Expenditure data

Expenditure data come from a wider variety of sources than tax data. This is because public sector expenditure covers a much wider array of agencies and organisations, as well as broad themes and categories of spend, than tax data. The complication of tax data is largely in the multiple rules around what specifically is taxed, and how that tax applies geographically. In comparison, expenditure data are complex in that multiple organisations, covering multiple geographies, spend public monies according to various expenditure rules.

Much of the local government expenditure known is provided through DCLG’s outturn data on revenue and capital expenditure. However, not all local public sector expenditure is spent through local authorities. Multiple other organisations are funded through several organisations or departments. For example, public protection funding goes through local police and local authorities, depending on the focus of the funding.

Though there are multiple sources of data, the main sources of public sector expenditure are DCLG’s aforementioned revenue and capital outturn statistics; the Department for Work and Pensions’ benefit expenditure data; the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (for central government expenditure); NHS England; StatsWales; and the Scottish Government.

Where data are not already provided at a local level, a disaggregation methodology has been applied. As with tax data, the main disaggregation method is by population, taking population from annual Mid-Year Population Estimates, produced by ONS. For police and crime commissioner expenditure, this is split by numbers of crimes per year, taken from national statistics. In many cases, this is not provided to a local level, and so a population disaggregation has been added to a crime disaggregation.

For CCG areas, the ONS lookup for LSOAs to CCGs was used alongside population estimates by LSOA from ONS. This was used to apportion expenditure to different local areas, especially where one area was contained (at least partially) within more than one CCG. Around 40% of CCGs covered more than one local authority area.

The disaggregation to local areas was based on the local areas that the particular authority covered. This may produce some erroneous results, especially where authorities responsible for expenditure did not wholly cover an area. In the case of National Park Authorities, where no direct look-up was available, the split has been based on the entire population of the areas covered, even if the national park covers only a portion of that area. For example, the Peak District National Park only partly covers Oldham, and yet the entire Oldham population has been used to calculate the proportion of spend by the National Park Authority within Oldham.

The table in Appendix B shows how the disaggregations of the expenditure data have been made to the local authority level.
