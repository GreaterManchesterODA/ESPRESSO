# Future developments
The ESPRESSO tool will continue to be developed, and will primarily focus on four areas of work: adding new data; evolving methodologies; improving the tool’s usability; and supporting the drive for more data availability.

## New data
In addition to adding in data for further years – including pre-2013 and post-2015 – the ESPRESSO team will continue to look for new data sources meeting with the general principles outlined above.

Additional data sources have already been outlined that could support the ESPRESSO tool, and the team will explore their efficacy. Identified areas of spend include further breakdowns for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as a better understanding of education and skills spending within the UK more generally.

Where further data are identified that would also help to better identify geographically accurate national government spend, the ESPRESSO team will aim to identify how this can be incorporated into the work.

## Improving and evolving methodologies
The current methodologies for disaggregating data to a local level will continue to be assessed, and where improvements can be made these will be added to new releases of the ESPRESSO tool.

Several areas have already been identified where additional or variant methodologies could be applied. One of these areas in the disaggregation of income tax. Currently, this is based on where income is earned rather than on where the employee lives. As a result, the methodology increases tax take in areas of high employment or high-value employment, and reduces it in areas of high net out-commuting. An option for switching between workplace-based and residence-based methodologies is currently being considered.

Additionally, other taxes may largely be based on sales rather than residence, and as such additional variant methodologies may also be explored, using GVA as a disaggregating factor.

## Improve the ESPRESSO tool
The ESPRESSO tool is currently an Excel spreadsheet – two sheets with the relevant data, a pivot table displaying this information and various macros that support this work.

The longer-term aim of the ESPRESSO tool is to make it more widely available and more widely used. This relies on having a simple user interface that allows users to access the data. We will continue to explore options for improving the usability of the data, improving the user interface and providing new tools to explore the data.

## Support the drive for greater data accessibility
ESPRESSO relies on the use of existing open data in set formats. Large sections of data – especially expenditure data provided at the local authority level – are from existing open datasets. However, a significant portion of the data sources are from individual financial reports and accounts.

The ESPRESSO team will continue to support the creation of open data sets, and will continue to support the use of these datasets.
